<h1>Final Project Proposal</h1>
<body>
    <p>
        For my final website project, I will be making a portfolio and contacting information site hybrid. It will include sections that link to other cites hosting things like comic series, reels, and perhaps more. The later half will consist of a description/instruction on how commissioning me/contacting me for work goes and it will include a section that allows users to send an email sending program.

        I do intend to use this website going forward seeing as it is a perfect place to sed people who wish to commission me for work later down the line, and as for a portfolio piece, I may use it as an extension to show my multimedia skills but probably not much else. This website is more of a means to an end seeing as I am not a fan of coding and donâ€™t wish to pursue much experimentation in the future, thus it is also a much smaller project compared to everything else I am doing down the line.
        
        I wish to learn very basic web layouts with this project and use it as a tool for my freelance business going forward (knock out two birds with one stone). As such, I am very keen on making it very intuitive to navigate and use (mainly due to the NUMEROUS idiotic clients I have delt with in the past).
        Below I will submit some examples of websites that i will use as inspiration to what i wish to create:
        
        
        https://serebit.com/
        https://evanscotthuber.com/about/
        https://natyoung.format.com/about
        
        Knowing how bad I am at this though, I will need to gain assistance from others in this process and will be sending constant updates for feedback as the weeks go by.
